### This is my repository for the first module of course "yandex.practicum: middle frontend developer"
---

You can play with it on https://mfd-chat.herokuapp.com/

### Installation

```
npm install
```

To test it locally, run:
```
npm run dev
```

For production build use
```
npm run build
```

For serving content with express:
```
npm run start
```

For linting and tests:
```
npm test
npm run lint
```

For linting with autofix:
```
npm run lint:fix
```
Husky is used with git pre-commit hook, so commits won't run untill all tests passed and linter has no complains.

I use default design with slight modifications, it can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/xGry8BbtARgzEGHvGRzpXp/Chat_Yury)
